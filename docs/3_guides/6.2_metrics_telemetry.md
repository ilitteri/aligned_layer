# Metrics and telemetry setup

## Metrics service

To run Prometheus and Grafana, run:

```bash
make run_metrics
```

This will start containers for Prometheus and Grafana. You can access Grafana on `http://localhost:3000` with the default credentials `admin:admin`.

Alternately, you can access the raw scrapped metrics collected with Prometheus on `http://localhost:9091/metrics`.

## Telemetry service

To setup the telemetry service run:

If it is your first time first you'll need to execute the following commands:

```bash
make telemetry_create_env
make telemetry_build_db
```

Then, to start the service:

```bash
make telemetry_full_start
```

This will:

- Start OpenJaeger container for the traces: available at `http://localhost:16686/`
- Start telemetry server: available at `http://localhost:4001/`
