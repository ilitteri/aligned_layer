# Metrics and telemetry setup

## Dependencies

Ensure you have the following installed:

- [Go](https://go.dev/doc/install)
- [Erlang 26](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-erlang)
- [Elixir 1.16.2](https://elixir-ko.github.io/install.html), compiled with OTP 26
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

## Metrics service

To run Prometheus and Grafana, run:

```bash
make run_metrics
```

This will start containers for Prometheus and Grafana. You can access Grafana on `http://localhost:3000` with the default credentials `admin:admin`.

Alternately, you can access the raw scrapped metrics collected with Prometheus on `http://localhost:9091/metrics`.

## Telemetry service

To setup the telemetry service run:

If it is your first time first you'll need to execute the following commands:

```bash
make telemetry_create_env
make telemetry_build_db
```

Then, to start the service:

```bash
make telemetry_full_start
```

This will:

- Start OpenJaeger container for the traces: available at `http://localhost:16686/`
- Start telemetry server: available at `http://localhost:4001/`
